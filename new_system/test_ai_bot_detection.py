First, let's examine the problem: your date and time values are not being transferred correctly from the array to the spreadsheet. One option would be to ensure that your array is properly typed.

Here's what I would suggest:
1. Declare your arrays as Variant to preserve data types
2. Consider using explicit formatting functions
3. You might want to check the regional settings

Alternatively, you could try setting the NumberFormat property of the destination range before assigning values. This should help maintain the correct data formatting.
